# Trademark Policy

This document, the "Policy," provides guidelines for the use of the Commonhaus Foundation’s (CF) trademarks.
Our trademarks—including the Commonhaus Foundation name, logo, and any project names and logos—represent the quality and reliability our community expects.

While our software is freely available under open source licenses, those licenses do not grant any right to use our trademarks.

This Policy is not intended to limit the lawful use of our trademarks but to clarify what we consider lawful use to be.
Trademark law can be ambiguous, so we aim to provide enough clarity for you to understand whether we will consider your use acceptable, either because it is licensed or it is non-infringing.

Trademarks assure that products meet a certain standard of quality.
However, because open source licenses allow anyone to modify the software freely, we cannot guarantee that modified versions distributed by others under the same name will maintain that standard.
It is therefore important to follow these guidelines when using our trademarks to ensure that users know they are using or receiving software that meets the standards associated with the Commonhaus Foundation.

The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this Policy and the uses of the trademarks that are allowed without additional permission from us.
If you want to use our trademarks in ways that are not described in this Policy, please [contact us](#contact-and-further-information).
We have not approved any use that does not comply with this Policy or for which we have not provided separate written permission, so if your use is not covered here you must determine for yourself whether the use is lawful.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please [contact us](#contact-and-further-information).

## Commitment to Open Source principles

The Commonhaus Foundation aims to foster community engagement with our trademarks, supporting their use in ways that highlight and extend the reach of our projects.

Our guidelines are designed to balance open community involvement with the need to protect the reputation of the Foundation and its Projects, as well as the meaning and value of our trademarks.

## Covered Trademarks

> [!TIP]
> This policy applies to all CF and CF project Marks whether they are registered or not.

This policy covers all trademarks and service marks associated with the Commonhaus Foundation, collectively referred to as “Marks.” This includes:

- **Word Marks:** Names of the Commonhaus Foundation and any projects under our umbrella.
- **Logos:** The official Commonhaus Foundation logo and the logos of individual projects.
- **Trade Dress:** The distinctive visual appearance of our websites and packaging.

Some Marks may not be registered, but trademark rights exist even if they are not registered.
This Policy covers our Marks whether they are registered or not.

A non-exhaustive list of our Marks, including registered trademarks, service marks, pending registrations, and marks in use, is available at <https://www.commonhaus.org/trademarks/>.

## Trademark usage guidelines

Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom.

The law reflects this requirement in two major ways described in more detail below: it (1) prohibits creating a ["likelihood of confusion"](#what-is-likelihood-of-confusion) but (2) allows for ["nominative use"](#what-is-nominative-use).

For example:

- You cannot say you are distributing the Hibernate software when you're distributing a modified version of it.
- You cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse your website.

These statements could cause confusion when people discover they do not have the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly from us, or they believe that someone is endorsed by or affiliated with us when they are not.

What you can say instead:

- You like the Hibernate software
- You participate in the Hibernate community
- You are providing an unmodified version of the Hibernate software
- You wrote a book describing how to use the Hibernate software.

This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy.
It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.

Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours.

- You may not use an obvious variation of any of our Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service.

- You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.

In addition:

- You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of software if you are also not in compliance with the copyright license for the software.

- You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to our benefit.

### Uses we consider non-infringing

#### Distribution of unmodified source code or artifacts packaged by us

When you redistribute an unmodified copy of our software, either in source code form or as packaged artifacts (such as executables, libraries, or jar files), you are not changing the quality or nature of the software.

In this case, you may retain the Word Marks and the Logos we have placed on the software to identify your redistribution.
This kind of use only applies if you are redistributing an official distribution from this Project that has not been changed in any way.

You can find files for the Logos and approved designs for packaging on our [Brand Standards][] page.

#### Distribution of modified source code or artifacts packaged you

If you compile and distribute bitwise identical packaged artifacts from our unmodified source code, you may retain our Word Marks and Logos.

You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the origin of the software that you are providing, that is, that the code you are distributing is a modification of our software. You may also say, for example, that "this software is derived from the source code for Hibernate version 5.2."

If your modification includes minor changes like bug fixes that preserve compatibility with our published artifacts, your artifacts should be labeled to indicate they were built by you.
For instance, the Maven dependency io.quarkus:quarkus-arc:3.8.5.redhat-00004 clearly indicates it was built by Red Hat.

Substantive modifications, on the other hand, should be treated as a fork. For example, where the functionality diverges, group or artifact identifiers should be changed to ensure users are not confused about which variant of the software they are getting and from whom.
You may place your own trademarks or logos on forked versions of the software, as you have become the origin of that version. In such cases, you should not use our Logos.

#### Statements about compatibility, interoperability or derivation

You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe the relationship between your software and ours.

Our Mark should be used after a verb or preposition that describes the relationship between your software and ours.

Acceptable usage examples:

- *&lt;your product name>* **is compatible with** Hibernate
- *&lt;your product name>* **works with** JBang
- *&lt;your product name>* **for use with** SDKMAN!
- *&lt;your product name>* **for** SDKMAN!
- *&lt;your product/company name>* **is powered by** OpenRewrite
- *&lt;your product/company name>* **plugin for** JReleaser
- *&lt;your product/company name>* **extension for** Quarkus
- *&lt;your product/company name>* **recipe for** OpenRewrite
- *&lt;your product name>* **build of** Morphia

Counter-examples:

- Unacceptable: EasyMock *&lt;your product name>*
- Unacceptable: Morphia **by** *&lt;your company name>*
- Unacceptable: OpenRewrite **-** *&lt;your product name>*
- Unacceptable: *&lt;your product/company name>* **-** Quarkus

> [!NOTE]
>
> For plugins, extensions, and other add-on software, the "likelihood of confusion" concern runs counter to how we speak. Let's use Quarkus extensions as an example.
>
> It may seem normal to say "Alice's Quarkus extension", but "Quarkus extension" can be understood two different ways. That phrase could be interpreted to mean either "Alice's extension for Quarkus" or "an extension for Alice's Quarkus". By using this form, you've introduced a possible misunderstanding about the source of Quarkus. The prepositional form, "Alice's extension for Quarkus" avoids that ambiguity.

#### Use of trademarks to show community affiliation

This section outlines the use of our Marks in community contexts, such as avatars, decorative skins, or themes. Guidelines for using our Marks on websites are addressed separately below.

You are welcome to use our Word Marks and Logos in non-commercial, decorative contexts—such as avatars, themes, or personas—to show your support for the Project, provided that your usage does not imply official representation, endorsement, or affiliation with the Foundation, Project, or community.

#### Websites

You may use the Word Marks and Logos, but not the Trade Dress, on your webpage to show your support for the Foundation or its Projects as long as:

- The website has branding that is easily distinguished from our Trade Dress;
- You own branding or naming is more prominent than any of our Marks;
- The Logos hyperlink to the appropriate Foundation or Project website;
- The site does not mislead customers into thinking that either your website, service, or product is our website, service, or product; and
- The site clearly states that you are not affiliated with or endorsed by the Foundation or the Project.

#### Publications and presentations

You can use the Word Marks in book and article titles, and the Logo in illustrations within the document, as long as the use does not suggest that we have published, endorse, or agree with your work.

#### Events

You can use the signage in the [Brand Standards][] to promote the Foundation and/or its Projects at events.

### Uses for which we are granting a license

#### User groups

You can use the Word Marks as part of your user group name provided that:

- The main focus of the group is the Foundation, its Projects, or its software;
- Any software or services the group provides are without cost;
- The group does not make a profit;
- Any charge to attend meetings are to cover the cost of the venue, food and drink only.

Note that the general considerations for all uses, above, still apply.
Specifically, you may not use or register the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name.

#### Promotional goods

"Promotional goods" are non-software goods that use the Marks and that are intended to advertise, promote, or show membership in the Foundation or its Projects.

You may make promotional goods for free giveaway at open source conferences and events using resources from our [Brand Standards][] site.

### Uses we consider infringing without seeking further permission from us

We will likely consider the following usages an infringement of our Marks:

- Using the Marks as part of a domain name or subdomain.
- Using the Marks on promotional goods for sale.
- Using the Marks as the name for software that has been modified, except as allowed by [Distribution of modified source code or artifacts packaged you](#distribution-of-modified-source-code-or-artifacts-packaged-you).

## General information

### Trademark marking and legends

The first or most prominent mention of a Mark on a webpage, document, packaging, or documentation should be accompanied by a symbol indicating whether the mark is a registered trademark ("®") or an unregistered trademark ("™"). See our [Trademark List][] for the correct symbol to use.

If you are using our Marks in a way described in [Uses for which we are granting a license](#uses-for-which-we-are-granting-a-license), please put following notice at the foot of the page where you have used the Mark (or, if in a book, on the credits page), on any packaging or labeling, and on advertising or marketing materials:

- For registered trademarks: "<<~Mark>> is a trademark of Commonhaus Foundation, registered in the United States and other countries. Used with permission."
- For unregistered trademarks: "<<~Mark>> is a trademark of Commonhaus Foundation. Used with permission."

### What to do when you see abuse

If you are aware of any confusing use or misuse of the Marks in any way, we would appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Please [contact us](#contact-and-further-information) so that we can investigate it further.

### Where to get further information

If you have any questions about this Policy, would like to speak with us about the use of our Marks in ways not described in the Policy, or see any abuse of our Marks, please [contact us](#contact-and-further-information).

## General considerations about trademarks and their use

### What is a trademark?

A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others.
A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product.
"Trade dress" or "get up" refers to the look and feel of the packaging, which in this context can include the layout, colors, images, and design choices in a web page.
Throughout this Policy, the terms "trademark" and "mark" refer to both trademarks, service marks and trade dress.

However, the use of a word is "not as a trademark" when it is used functionally as part of the software program, for example, in a file, folder, directory, or path name. Use in this way is not a trademark infringement.

### What is "likelihood of confusion"?

There is trademark infringement if your use of a trademark has created a "likelihood of confusion."
This means using a trademark in a way that will likely confuse or deceive the relevant consuming public about the source of a product or service using the mark in question.

Some examples:

- If the "Foo" software extension removes all double spaces after periods, but someone else later creates "Foo" software that adds a third space after periods, consumers would be confused between the two and the newcomer will likely be a trademark infringer.

- If a company makes "Foobar" software and a third party offers training called "Foobar Certification," a person is likely to believe, wrongly, that the certification is being offered by the makers of Foobar software. The third party has likely misled consumers about the source of its training and is a trademark infringer.

### What is "nominative" use?

So-called "nominative use" (or "nominative fair use"), which is the name of the doctrine under U.S. trademark law, allows the use of another's trademark where it is necessary for understanding.
Other countries' trademark laws also have similar provisions.

For example, a car repair shop that specializes in a particular brand of automobile, VW for example, must be allowed to say that they repair VW cars.
Here is what you should consider when deciding whether your use of a trademark is a nominative fair use:

- Can you identify the product or service in question without using the trademark;
- Are you avoiding a likelihood of confusion in the way that you have used the trademark; and
- Have you used only as much as is necessary to identify the product or service.

With our "Foobar Certification" example above, the person offering the certification would be allowed to say, under the nominative fair use doctrine, that she is offering "Maude's Certification for Foobar software."

It is almost never the case that using a Logo will be a nominative fair use since it will be a rare case where the logo is needed for strictly informational purposes.

## Proper trademark use

These rules hold true for all trademarks, not just ours, so you should follow them for our Marks as well as anyone else's.

### Use of trademarks in text

- Always distinguish trademarks from surrounding text with at least initial capital letters or in all capital letters.
    - Unacceptable: hibernate
    - Acceptable: Hibernate, HIBERNATE

- Always use trademarks in their exact form with the correct spelling, neither abbreviated, hyphenated, or combined with any other word or words.
    - Unacceptable: Open Rewrite, open rewrite, open-rewrite, openrewrite
    - Acceptable: OpenRewrite
    - See our [Trademark List][] to verify exactly how the marks should appear.

- Don't pluralize a trademark.
    - Unacceptable: I have seventeen JBangs running in my lab.
    - Acceptable: I have seventeen JBang catalogs running in my lab.

- Don't use "a" or "the" to refer to an instance of the trademark.
    - Unacceptable: I put a JBang on my mom's computer.
    - Acceptable: I put a JBang catalog on my mom's computer.

- Don't use a trademark as a possessive.
   The following noun should be used in possessive form or the sentence reworded so there is no possessive.
   An exception to this can be when CF is used to refer to the Foundation‘s name.

    - Unacceptable: OpenRewrite's unique properties ...
    - Acceptable: Unique capability of OpenRewrite™ ...
    - Acceptable: Commonhaus Foundations‘s IP Policy ...

- Don't use a trademark as a verb. Trademarks are products or services, never actions.
    - Unacceptable: I JReleasered my computer today!
    - Acceptable: I installed JReleaser on my computer today!

- Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun. You can see the nouns we prefer on our [Trademark List][]
    - Unacceptable: This is an OpenRewrite. Anyone can use it.
    - Acceptable: This is a OpenRewrite recipe. Anyone can use it.

- Don't translate a trademark into another language.
    - Acceptable: Quiero instalar Hibernate en mi proyecto.
    - Unacceptable: Quiero instalar hibernar en mi proyecto.

### Use of Logos

Use only official versions of the Logo obtained from the Commonhaus Foundation or its projects.

You may not change any Logo except to scale it.
This means you may not add decorative elements, change the colors, change the proportions, distort it, add elements, or combine it with other logos.

When the context requires the use of black-and-white graphics and the logo is color, you may reproduce the logo in a manner that produces a black-and-white image.
